## Required

-   fill in mono-repo README
-   make sure everything is exported
-   add a dev port scanner so a frontend can find their backend.
    -   or, alternatively, add a generated file that a frontend can import and a backend can populate with a list of ports

## Not required

-   add more info logging
-   support socket message buffers
-   omit `HttpMethod.Options` from an endpoint init's methods object because it is always allowed anyway
