-   add typed web sockets
-   test `fetchEndpoint` within `run-service`
-   add a new `run-endpoint` package
    -   export `testEndpoint`
    -   make sure `implement-service` can depend on it
    -   probably will need to split some functionality out of `run-service` and put it into `run-endpoint` instead so that it can be used to test endpoints in `implement-service`
-   replace `undefined` `requiredAuth` functionality with a new `NoAuth` export, similar to how `AnyOrigin` is used
-   add typed search params
