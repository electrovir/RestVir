-   add typed web sockets
-   add `testEndpoint` export
-   replace `undefined` `requiredAuth` functionality with a new `NoAuth` export, similar to how `AnyOrigin` is used
-   add typed search params
-   omit `HttpMethod.Options` from an endpoint init's methods object because it is always allowed anyway
-   make each endpoint in an implemented service standalone so it can be tested on its own
    -   meaning, each endpoint object includes its implementation
-   Make sure all JSDocs have a `@package` tag and a `@category Package` tag
